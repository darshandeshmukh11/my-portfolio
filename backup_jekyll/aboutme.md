### My early career days

I started my career as a Software Tester. I worked for a couple of startups to automated their manual testing setup to fully integrated automated regression suites. While doing this automation work I got an opportunity to implement first cut of DevOps. Infrastructure orchestration caught my attention and started exploring on moving the code from developers machine to production.
